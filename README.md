- `npm run build` - Build the React app for production
- `npm start` - Start the production server
- `npm run install-all` - Install dependencies for both server and client

## Environment Variables

## Migration Notes

This project was converted from Next.js to Node.js. Key changes:
- Removed Next.js specific features (SSR, file-based routing)
- Added Express.js backend with REST API
- Moved React components to separate client directory
- Updated import paths and routing
- Added proxy configuration for development
- Implemented static file serving for production

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

The conversion is complete and the application is ready to run! The portfolio maintains all its original functionality while now running on a Node.js backend with a React frontend.
